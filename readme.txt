Show character countdown in the Editor for Pages, Posts and Excerpts

Help editors by showing a character countdown reference on Pages, Posts or Excerpts.

Note: This plugin does not actually limit the number of characters that appear on the front end, it just displays the count in the backend as a reference as you edit your content.
